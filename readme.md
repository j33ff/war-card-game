## WAR CARD GAME

```

RULES: 

The goal is to be the first player to win all 52 cards

THE DEAL
The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards.

THE PLAY
Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card 
takes both cards and puts them at the bottom of their card deck.

If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player turns up one card face down 
and one card face up. The player with the higher cards takes both piles (six cards). 
If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, each player places another card face 
down and turns another card face up. The player with the higher card takes all 10 cards, 
and so on.

The cards have the normal rank from highest to lowest: ace, king, queen, jack, and then 10 through 2.

HOW TO KEEP SCORE
The game ends when one player has won all the cards.
